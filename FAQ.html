<h2>Purpose</h2>
<div>The purpose of this website is to show a few examples of how do find influental doctors in a specific area; in this example, 
psychiatrists in the Philadelphia area.
</div>
<br />


<h2>Directions</h2>

<p><b>Results table</b> (Home page)
<br />
The table provides a list of all doctors in the area that can be exported to other formats.
<ul>
<li>clicking a column sorts the column</li>
<li>search will filter the table based upon your input</li>
<li>navigation allows you to go to a specific page</li>
<li>the export buttons allow you to download the data in varous formats.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Network Diagram</b>
<br /> 
The network diagram is visual of the relationships between the doctors. This type of diagram can provide insight in how the doctors communicate with their peers. This diagram is also interactive; some of the features are:
<ul>
<li>The top 10 most inluential doctors are bolded.</li>
<li>The colors and the bubbles respresent the natural groupings of the doctors. The groupings are based off of communications in the network.</li>
<li>Each node can be draggedd to a location, in order to provide better visability. </li>
<li>Hoovering over a node displays that doctor's name.</li>
<li>Clicking on a node provides demographic data on that doctor</li>
<li>Double clicking a node will highlight that doctors nearest neighbors.</li>
<li>Clicking a node size option adjust the size of the node in propotion to the parameter selected. i.e selecting prescriptions changes node size to represent the number of prescriotions they wrote in a year.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p><b>3D Network Diagram</b></p>
<ul>
<li>left click rotates the diagram</li>
<li>mouse wheel will zoom in and out</li>
<li>right click pans the diagram</li>
<li>Hoovering over a node displays that doctor's name.</li>
<li>Clicking on a node provides demographic data on that doctor</li>
<li>Clicking a node size option adjust the size of the node in propotion to the parameter selected. i.e selecting prescriptions changes node size to represent the number of prescriotions they wrote in a year.</li>

</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li><B>Is the data presented real data?</B>  Yes, if you needed a sales list of Philadelphia psychiatrists the data here could be used as your target list. </li>
<li><B>Where did the data come from?</B>  Bluejacket gathers data daily from numerous sources such as the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, 
National Provider Identifier Registry, Census Bureau, Clinical Trials, Scientic Journals, social media and news casts then combines this data into a single 
coherent story using AI processes.</li>
<li><B>Can other target lists be generated?</B> Yes, our database has billions of records and contains every healthcare provider in the United States along with every medical journal article 
and every drug produced which allows us to filter the data in thousands of ways for unparalleled accuracy.</li>
<li><B>How many doctors can be in a network?</B> An unlimited amount; however, the visual displays get very busy making it difficult to gain insight from the diagrams.</li>
<li><B>How do you determine influence?</B> The alogrithms used are based off network science, social science and applied mathematics. The process is similar to how Google finds the 
best (most influential) page based upon your search criteria. The home page table field labeled "Rank" is a rank of the doctor's influence.</li>
<li><B>Can you prove you are measuring influence?</B>  Yes, we have run several research studies that have statistically proven we are measuring influence.</li>
</ul>
